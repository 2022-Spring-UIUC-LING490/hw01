# HW00

In this homework, you will use foma to implement the kaNpat exercise from 

Your task is to implement the kaNpat exercise from ยง3.5.3 of the textbook (p. 137-141).

You will edit the file kaNpat.foma. In that file, you should do the following:
* define the two rules needed for this exercise
* compose the two rules appropriately, such that the resulting machine is on the stack

You should next read the contents of Makefile and ensure that you understand what each line is doing. 

* In the file understanding-Makefile.txt, write a short description (a few sentences) describing what each part of the Makefile is doing. 

You may find it helpful to refer to the [GNU Make documentation on pattern rule syntax](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Rules), and to the foma documentation by running `foma -help`

You can type `make kaNpat.test` to test your code.
